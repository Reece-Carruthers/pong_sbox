A simple pong game made in Facepunchs S&Box alpha test

Currently unfinished and needs more work

My intro to C# and game development and has helped me learn about basic C# principles, how games handle updates to a user, maths calculations, basic AI, basic UI designs and more.

Follows the rules of a standard game of Pong, with some slight variations. 
Future plan to add additional features and carry on improving the code and add more twists to the game.
